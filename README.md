# FOREX Pip and Profit Calculator

This Jupyter Notebook is designed to help **Forex traders** calculate pip values and potential profits based on currency pairs, lot sizes, and pip movements. It fetches **live exchange rates** using Yahoo Finance and provides real-time calculations of **pip values** and **potential profits** based on user inputs.

## Features
- **Live Exchange Rate Fetching**: Automatically fetches live exchange rates for currency pairs using the `yfinance` API.
- **Pip Value Calculation**: Determines the pip value for the specified currency pair and lot size.
- **Profit Calculation**: Estimates potential profit based on expected pip movements.
- **Manual Inputs**: Users can input the currency pair, lot size, and expected pip movement to get an immediate calculation.

## How It Works
1. **User Input**: You provide the following inputs:
   - **Currency pair** (e.g., EURUSD, GBPJPY).
   - **Lot size** (e.g., 1.0, 0.1, or 0.01).
   - **Pip movement** (expected change in pips, positive or negative).

2. **Live Exchange Rate Fetching**: The notebook fetches the **live exchange rate** for the provided currency pair using `yfinance`.

3. **Pip Value Calculation**: 
   The value of a pip is calculated differently depending on whether the currency pair involves the **Japanese Yen (JPY)** or other currencies. The general formula for pip value is:

   $$ \text{Pip Value} = \frac{\text{Pip Size}}{\text{Exchange Rate}} \times \text{Lot Size} $$

   Where:
   - **Pip Size** is typically `0.0001` for most currency pairs, except for pairs involving JPY where it's `0.01`.
   - **Exchange Rate** is the live rate for the currency pair.
   - **Lot Size** is the amount of the base currency being traded.

4. **Profit Calculation**:
   The estimated profit or loss is calculated based on the pip value and the expected pip movement:

   $$ \text{Profit/Loss} = \text{Pip Value} \times \text{Pip Movement} $$

   Where:
   - **Pip Value** is the value of one pip for the given currency pair and lot size.
   - **Pip Movement** is the number of pips the market has moved (positive for gains, negative for losses).

5. **Output**:
   The notebook will print:
   - The **live exchange rate** for the given currency pair.
   - The calculated **pip value** based on the lot size.
   - The estimated **profit or loss** based on the pip movement.

## Example
For a currency pair like **EURUSD**, with a lot size of `1.0` and an expected pip movement of `50 pips`:
- If the live exchange rate is `1.0965`, the pip value would be calculated as:

  $$ \text{Pip Value} = \frac{0.0001}{1.0965} \times 1.0 = 0.00009 $$

- If the pip movement is `50 pips`, the estimated profit would be:

  $$ \text{Profit} = 0.00009 \times 50 = 0.0045 \text{ USD} $$

The tool helps traders estimate how much profit or loss they can expect from specific trades.

## Prerequisites

Before running the notebook, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- **Python 3.x**
- **pandas** for data manipulation
- **yfinance** for fetching live exchange rates

You can install the required libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install pandas yfinance
```

## Running the Notebook

1. **Clone the repository** or download the notebook file.
   
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas yfinance
   ```

3. Open the notebook and run all the cells to interact with the live Forex calculator.

## Future Enhancements

- **Live Alerts**: Add real-time notifications for specific currency movements.
- **Leverage Calculation**: Incorporate leverage into profit/loss calculations.
- **Historical Data**: Include an option to fetch and analyze historical data for longer-term trend analysis.
